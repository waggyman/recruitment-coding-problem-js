### LIST OF PROBLEM SOLVED
In this repository, I made a code to solve some problems givem by company recruiters. Most of it are Algorithms Test.
I know it's still far from good and I believe some of you may have better solutions to solve the problems in this repo. Because of that, feel free to create a pull request or create an issue for this.

I tried to solve all of the problems in Javascript programming language without using any library. It helps me understand more.

### How to use
It's basically simple javascript program. So I suggest you to do:
```shell
1. Clone the repository
2. Check the codebase
3. Run the problem with:

$ node {folder-name}/index.js
# Eg: node broken-channel-algorithm/index.js
```

### Discussion Supported Languages
In this repo, I will try to use English as much as I can. But I also open for any question, pull request, or issues written in my native language (Indonesian, Javaneese). Matur Thank You Banyak!
